# 📘 Topics to Learn Today


# 1. Basic Output
print("Hello, Python!")

# 2. Variables and Data Types
name = "Jane"
age = 25
height = 5.8
is_student = True

# 3. Input from User
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, ",  user_name)

# 4. Type Conversion
num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))        # Casting
num2 = float(input("Enter another number: "))
print(num1 + num2)

# 5. String Formatting
print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")


# 🧪 Practice Exercises (Do in VS Code)
# 1. Write a program that:

#   - Asks for your name, age, and country

#   - Prints a short profile summary using an f-string

# 2. Create a simple age calculator:

#   - Ask for birth year

#   - Calculate and print the current age

# 3. Create a converter:

#   - Input weight in kg

#   - Output weight in pounds (1 kg = 2.20462 lbs)

# 📁 When You’re Done
# Create a folder like day1_basics/

# Save your Python files (profile.py, age_calculator.py, etc.)

# Push to GitHub (I can help if needed)



# 🚀 Mini Challenge (Optional)
# Write a Python program that:

# Asks the user for 3 hobbies

# Prints them as a bulleted list
