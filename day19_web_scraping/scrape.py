response = requests.get(url)

parsed_html = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
# print(parsed_html) - inspection

quotes = parsed_html.find_all("span", class_= "text")
# print(quotes) - for inspection

authors = parsed_html.find_all("small", class_ = "author")
# print(authors)- for inspection

for quote, author in zip(quotes, authors):
